This project seeks to model the communication experiments presented in Rohde et al.'s 2012 "Communicating with Cost-based Implicature: a Game-Theoretic Approach to Ambiguity" as particle swarm optimization tasks. Pairs of participants in the experiments will be represented by pairs of interacting particles within the swarm, which will attempt to jointly maximize their score in communcation games by coordinating their use of ambiguous reference strategies. 

The model's success will be measured in terms of its ability to emulate the final rates of reference coordination and ambiguous form usage seen in the Rohde et al. experiments. To achieve
